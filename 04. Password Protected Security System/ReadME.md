### Components
1. Arduino Uno R3 (x1)
2. 	Keypad 4x4 (x1)
3. Red LED (x1)
4. Green LED (x1)
5. 1 kâ„¦ Resistor (x2)
6. 	Piezo (x1)

### Keypad 4x4
A 4x4 keypad is a matrix keypad with 4 rows and 4 columns, typically used for user input on embedded systems like Arduino

- Working Principle
  - Each key is at the intersection of a row and a column
  - The keypad has 8 pins: 4 for rows and 4 for columns.
  - To detect a keypress, the microcontroller scans rows and columns by sending signals and reading responses.

- Applications
  - Password entry
  - Menu navigation
  - Home automation control panels 
  - DIY projects with Arduino
