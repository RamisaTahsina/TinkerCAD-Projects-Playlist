### Capacitor

A Capacitor is a two terminal passive electronic component that stores electrial energy in an electric field. 

 - Woking principle:   
 when a voltage is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, it accumulates electric charge on its plates.
   - One plate accumulates positive charge.
   -  The other accumulates an equal ammount of negative charge.

   This stored energy can be released when needed.

 - Formula :
 Capacitance(C) is measured in Farads(F). Indicates how much charge the capaciot can store per volt.   
 C=QV ; Q is charge and V is the voltage. 
 
    Typicals capacitors  have values in microFarads, nanoFarads(nF) or picoFarads(pF).

  - Applications
    - Smoothing in Power supplies(filtering voltage fluctuations)
    - Timing Circuits(with resistors RC circuit)
    - Coupling ot decoupling AC and DC circuits
    - Energy Storage (flash in cameras)
    - Tuning Radios(in LC circuits)
