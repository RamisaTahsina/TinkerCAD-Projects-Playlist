### Components
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Positional Micro Servo

### Positonal Micro Servo

A positional micro servo is a small, lightweight motor with built-in electronics that can rotate to a specific angle, typically 0° to 180° (some models can go a bit beyond). It’s used in many hobby and robotics projects for precise movements.

 - Working Principle
   - You send a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to the servo.
   - The width of the pulse tells the servo which angle to move to.

     - 1 ms pulse → ~0°

     - 1.5 ms pulse → ~90°

     - 2 ms pulse → ~180°

   - The servo holds its position after moving—great for controlling arms, levers, and dials.


 - Applications
   - Robot arms

   - Pan/tilt camera mounts

   - Animatronics

   - RC cars, boats, planes

   - Automated levers and switches
