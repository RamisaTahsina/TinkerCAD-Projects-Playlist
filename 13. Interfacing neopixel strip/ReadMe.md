1. Arduino Uno R3
2. NeoPixel Strip 4

### NeoPixel Strip 4
A NeoPixel Strip 4 typically refers to an addressable RGB LED strip that has 4 LEDs. Each LED is individually programmable—you can set its color and brightness independently.

NeoPixel is Adafruit’s brand name for these addressable LEDs (the common type is WS2812B). They usually use a single DIN (Data IN) line to control the strip.

 - Working Principle
   - control the LEDs by sending a timing-specific signal.
   - The LEDs can show any color (RGB) and varying brightness.
   - Libraries like Adafruit_NeoPixel make controlling them very easy.

 - Applications
   -  RGB lighting effects
   - Indicators
   - Mood lighting
   - LED animations
   -  Visual feedback in electronics projects
