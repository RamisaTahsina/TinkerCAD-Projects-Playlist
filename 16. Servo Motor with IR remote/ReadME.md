### IR Remote
IR (InfraRed) remotes are a handheld wireless device to operate other electronic devices. IR remotes act as a transmitter that carries signals from remote to the devices it controls. It emits lights in an infrared range that corresponds to specific commands, such as power on, volume up, etc. The controlled device acts as a receiver. It decodes the infrared pulses of light and executes the command.
