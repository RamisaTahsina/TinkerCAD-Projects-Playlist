### Components:
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. RCBG LED RGB
3. PIR Sensor
4. Piezo
5. 1 kΩ Resistor (x9)

### PIR sensor
A PIR sensor (Passive Infrared sensor) detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation (heat) in its field of view.

 - Workinng Principle
   - All objects emit infrared radiation (IR), especially warm objects like humans or animals.

   - The PIR sensor has two IR-sensitive elements:

     - If the IR level stays constant → no motion detected.

     - If IR level changes (like a person walking) → motion detected.




  - Applications
    -  Automatic lights
    - Alarms and security
    - Motion-activated cameras
    -  Energy saving (auto-off devices)
    - Home automation
