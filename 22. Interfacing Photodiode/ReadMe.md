### Components
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Photodiode
3. 1 kΩ Resistor

### Photodiode
A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into an electrical current. It acts like a light sensor—when light hits the photodiode, it generates a small current proportional to the intensity of the light.

- Working Principle
  - In darkness, the current is very small.
  - Under light, the current increases.
  - The stronger the light, the stronger the current.

 - Application
   -  Light sensors (LDR replacement)
   - Optical communication
   - Infrared sensors
   - Pulse oximeters
   - Barcode scanners
   - Safety equipment
   - CD/DVD players
