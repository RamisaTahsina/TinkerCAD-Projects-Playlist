### LDR-Light Dependent Resistor
LDR is a photoresistor that works on the principle of photoconductivity. The surface of the LDR is made with a layer of semiconducting material that is responsible for measuring the light intensity. The principle states that when light falls on the surface of the semiconducting material, the electrons receive energy, and movement is caused inside the material. 


When those electrons reach the valence band, electron-hole pairs are formed. This in turn reduces the resistance of the material and the corresponding voltage is given as the output of the device.

- Working Principle

   The working principle of an LDR sensor is based on the fact that the resistance of the semiconductor material within the LDR changes with varying light levels. In bright light, the resistance decreases, allowing more current to flow through the LDR. In low light or darkness, the resistance increases, limiting the current flow. This change in resistance is exploited in circuits to detect and respond to changes in ambient light conditions. When the LDR is exposed to light, the voltage across it changes, which can be used to control other components in a circuit, such as LEDs, relays, or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
 
  By combining LDRs with microcontrollers like the Arduino, you can create responsive and intelligent systems that adapt to changes in light conditions and trigger appropriate actions based on those changes.

 - Applications
   - Automatic Streetlights: LDRs are used to detect darkness and turn on streetlights automatically when it gets dark.
   -  Camera Exposure Control: In photography, LDRs help control the exposure settings of cameras based on available light. 
   - Security Systems: LDRs can be used to trigger security alarms or lights when someone enters a room or area.
   - Outdoor Light Control: LDRs are used in garden lights and outdoor lighting systems to turn on lights as dusk sets in.
   - Solar Panels: LDRs can detect changes in sunlight to optimize the positioning of solar panels for maximum efficiency.
   - Weather Stations: LDRs can be used to measure sunlight levels in weather stations to understand climate conditions.
