This project demonstrates how different values of potentiometer can light up different patterns in LEDs. 

### Components
- Arduino Uno R3 (x1)
- Red LED (x2)
- Yellow LED ( x2)
- Green LED (x2)
- 220 Ω Resistor (x6)
- 250 kΩ Potentiometer (x1)

### Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact (called a wiper) that forms an adjustable voltage divider

 - Working Principal
   - It consists of a resistive element (a strip of material with uniform resistance).
   - The two ends of the strip are connected to two terminals.
   - A third terminal (the wiper) slides across the strip.
   - By moving the wiper, one can change the ratio of resistance between one end and the wiper, and the wiper and the other end—this changes the output voltage.

 - Application
   -    Adjust levels (like volume control on a radio)
   - Tune circuits (like setting reference voltages)
   - Act as a user input (like in joysticks)
