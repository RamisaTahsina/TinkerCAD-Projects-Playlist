### Positonal Micro Servo

A positional micro servo is a small, lightweight motor with built-in electronics that can rotate to a specific angle, typically 0° to 180° (some models can go a bit beyond). It’s used in many hobby and robotics projects for precise movements.

 - Working Principle
   - You send a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to the servo.
   - The width of the pulse tells the servo which angle to move to.

     - 1 ms pulse → ~0°

     - 1.5 ms pulse → ~90°

     - 2 ms pulse → ~180°

   - The servo holds its position after moving—great for controlling arms, levers, and dials.


 - Applications
   - Robot arms

   - Pan/tilt camera mounts

   - Animatronics

   - RC cars, boats, planes

   - Automated levers and switches

   ### Photodiode
A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into an electrical current. It acts like a light sensor—when light hits the photodiode, it generates a small current proportional to the intensity of the light.

- Working Principle
  - In darkness, the current is very small.
  - Under light, the current increases.
  - The stronger the light, the stronger the current.

 - Application
   -  Light sensors (LDR replacement)
   - Optical communication
   - Infrared sensors
   - Pulse oximeters
   - Barcode scanners
   - Safety equipment
   - CD/DVD players
