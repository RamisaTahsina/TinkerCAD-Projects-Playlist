### Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact (called a wiper) that forms an adjustable voltage divider

 - Working Principal
   - It consists of a resistive element (a strip of material with uniform resistance).
   - The two ends of the strip are connected to two terminals.
   - A third terminal (the wiper) slides across the strip.
   - By moving the wiper, one can change the ratio of resistance between one end and the wiper, and the wiper and the other endâ€”this changes the output voltage.

 - Application
   -    Adjust levels (like volume control on a radio)
   - Tune circuits (like setting reference voltages)
   - Act as a user input (like in joysticks)
